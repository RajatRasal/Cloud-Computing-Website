        <h1>What is Spark?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Apache Spark is an open source framework for cluster computing in the cloud. It was first developed by Matei Zaharia in 2009
          at the UC Berkeley AMPLab; it was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2013. Spark was created in
          response to some of the deficiencies identified in MapReduce due to inefficient data sharing.</p>
          <p>
          Firstly, MapReduce is inefficient with <b>iterative computations</b> that work on the same dataset repeatedly, as MapReduce
          must read data from the disk with every iteration, which takes too long. Secondly, MapReduce does not support
          <b>interactive applications</b> such as data analysis (e.g. making ad-hoc queries to the dataset) because with MapReduce,
           queries can take too long to process since the data must be read from stable storage.</p>
          <p>
          Spark does not have these issues for this class of problems as it uses <b>resilient distributed datasets (RDDs)</b>
          which allow it to perform the above computations in-memory. This means intermediate results are held in-memory
          so data can be accessed much faster. This improves the performance of computations greatly when we need to work
          on the same dataset many times (as in the above cases). Spark can perform some operations anywhere from 10x to
          100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce.</p>

        <h1>What is a Cluster?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>A cluster “consists of a collection of interconnected stand-alone computers working together as a single,
          integrated computing resource” (Buyya, 1999). A computer within the cluster is referred to as a node; nodes
          in the cluster are generally interconnected via an LAN (local area network). The nodes in the cluster are able
          to work individually or together, with all the other nodes in the cluster, providing support for parallel
          applications.</p>

        <h1>Resilient Distributed Datasets</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Resilient Distributed Datasets(RDDs) are “a distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory
          computations on large clusters” (Zaharia et al RDDs). RDDs partition the data across several nodes and are immutable
          allowing data to be accessed by multiple threads at once, safely, as the data is not changed.</p>
        <h2>RDD Operations</h2>

        <p>RDDs can only be formed from data that is already on the disk, or by transforming other RDDs. In Spark,
          transformation operations are performed lazily: the new dataset, formed by transforming an existing one, is only
          computed when it is required to. For example, an action operation may require a result to be returned, thus forcing
          the new RDD to be calculated. To illustrate this, let us look at the following example from the Spark Programming
          Guide which calculates the total length of a text file using the map and reduce operations:</p>

          <code> <font color="black"> <b> JavaRDD<String> lines = sc.textFile("data.txt");<br>
                 JavaRDD<Integer> lineLengths = lines.map(s -> s.length());<br>
                 int totalLength = lineLengths.reduce((a, b) -> a + b);</b></font></code>

        <p>
          <br>
        Line 1 first creates an RDD named “lines”. Line 2 uses the transformation operation “map” which changes the value of
        each line in “lines” to its length. Finally, the action operation “reduce” sums all the lengths in “lineLengths” in
        order to give the total length. Since the evaluation of transformations in Spark is lazy, the new RDD “lineLengths”
        is not actually evaluated until it is forced to by the action operation “reduce”, at the very end.</p>

        <h2>Fault Tolerance</h2>
        <p>Fault tolerance is the ability of the system to continue functioning even when some of the nodes have failed
          (Tannenbaum, van Steen, 2002). Fault tolerance is achieved by finding means of recovering lost data in the event
          of a failure due to some fault.</p>
        <p>RDDs have “resilient” in the name because they are fault tolerant. RDDs are fault tolerant because they store
          their lineage, allowing recovery of lost data: the “lineage” describes the way in which the dataset was derived
          from other RDDs. Therefore, lost nodes can be rebuilt using data from the disk by tracing the dependencies on
          other RDDs. This lineage can be represented in the form of  Directed Acyclic Graph (see next section).</p>
        <p>Immutability makes the tracing of lineage simpler as you are not able to change an RDD while tracking a lineage
          to rebuild a node. Nodes with large lineages can take a long time to reproduce as following the chain of dependencies
          can be costly: to fix this, Spark has an API to allow users to “checkpoint” certain pieces of data. Checkpointing
          in a fault-tolerant distributed system is the saving of data to stable storage at regular intervals to enable the
          recovery of lost data in the event of a failure (Coulouris, Dollimore & Kindberg, 2005): this reduces the size of
          the path of lineages that must be traced in order to recover the failed node.</p>
