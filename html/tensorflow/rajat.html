        <h1>What is TensorFlow?</h1>
        <hr>
		<h4 class="subtitle">Introduction</h4>
        <p> 
        TensorFlow is an open-source framework for performing mathematical computations, 
        primarily used for its portable, scalable implementations of machine learning 
        algorithms to applications such as deep neural networks. In this way, TensorFlow’s 
        implementation results in little effect to performance when scaling up 
        (large server clusters with GPUs) or scaling down (i.e. Android or IOS device). 
        This is further extended by the TensorFlow’s ability to conduct training and 
        execution aspects of ML algorithm efficiently in a distributed manner across 
        multiple, different computing devices.</p>
          
        <p> Deep Learning has massively influenced the field of Computer Science, with 
        these ideas giving rise to highly functional applications with ‘smart’ abilities. 
        Google was making use of these techniques to power the algorithms behind its 
        search, mail, photos and speech recognition tools 
        (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZikw5k_2FM). At the time, this was being done 
        with its DistBelief 
        (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/large_deep_networks_nips2012.pdf) 
        framework, but as the need for machine learning grew, a more robust and efficient 
        implementation was needed. TensorFlow arose from the need to generalise different 
        machine learning implementations across Google to allow engineers to reuse the 
        basic code base for future projects. After open-sourcing TF, 
        (https://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-open-sources-its-artificial-intelligence-engine/) 
        Google released a distributed version of the framework alongside its Google Cloud 
        Machine Learning infrastructure to train and serve TF models.</p><br>
          
        <h4 class="subtitle">Advantages to using TensorFlow for Cloud Computing</h4>
        <p> 
        The main advantages to using TensorFlow for any distributed, iterative calculation 
        (with the case of ML) stem from its implemented as a data flow graph. I will 
        explore these more as I go along, but will outline them here: 
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Portability - 
            At its heart TensorFlow is written in C++, however there also exist the more widely 
            used Java, Go, Python and a slightly higher level C++ API 
            (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) built on top of the C++ core. The 
            Python API being most prominently used in research and for any high level ML 
            applications. This abstraction gives rise to the graph data flow model, by 
            hiding the complexities of how the model is deployed and executed differently 
            on different platforms. With best practices being encoded at the low level, 
            developers can focus on the larger tasks at hand. Developers need not consider 
            how the core libraries are implementing algorithms on different devices, as 
            optimisation have been made to ensure similar runtimes across platforms. In 
            this way, we can abstract away the actual implementation and visual our algorithms 
            as a graph, with this being the high level models object orientated realisation. 
            In this way, Python’s TF API, for example, will allow for the same code to be 
            run on Android devices or across a large cluster of servers running on GPUs alike. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t64ortpgS-E) (Learning TensorFlow A Guide to Building Deep Learning Systems.pdf page 6)</li>

        During Compile time, the compiler converts the source code into Microsoft 
        Intermediate Language (MSIL). Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) are CPU-Independent
         set of instructions that can be effectively converted to the native code. Now with
          the help of JIT compiler, IL code can be executed on any computer architecture 
          supported by the JIT compiler.
